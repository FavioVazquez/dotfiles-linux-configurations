# Linux-configurations

My configurations on several programs and stuff. i3, vim, and others.

Some are bash files, i.e. scripts for running some tasks, and others are "dotfiles", mostly configurations I use for Vim, i3 the Vim pluging for Intellij Idea, etc. They are free to use, share, and as always suggestions are well received.
